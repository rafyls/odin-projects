# Sign-up Form: Car Rental

This project (signup-form) is the first project of the [Intermediate HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css).

The goal of this project is to build a sign-up form for an *imaginary* online service that rents cars.

In order to create the webpage as specified by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), they provided an initial design image to reference while coding:
