# Library

This project (library) is the first project of the [JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript).

The goal of this project is to build a small library application, that allows users to:
- Add a book to the library
- Remove a book from the library
- Display reading status (read or not read) of a book.
