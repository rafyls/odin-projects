# Landing Page: Vacclean

Vacclean is an *imaginary* company that sells different ranges of vaccum cleaners.

This project (landing-page) is the second project of the [Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

In order to create the webpage as specified by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/), they provided two initial design images to reference while coding:
